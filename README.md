# 🧠 Breast Cancer Classification - HIT ML Course Project

This machine learning project was completed as part of the **Machine Learning course at HIT**.  
It focuses on classifying breast cancer cases as **malignant** or **benign** using supervised learning techniques.

## 📌 Overview

- Developed in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebook**
- Based on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**
- Covers the full machine learning pipeline:
  - Data cleaning & preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training with multiple classifiers
  - Grid Search with **5-fold Cross-Validation**
  - Performance evaluation (accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix)

  ## 📊 Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🧪 Results

- Achieved high accuracy and F1 macro scores
- Strong classification performance on test data
- Useful visualizations to support evaluation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Running the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomerbitonn/Machine-Learning-Project2.git
cd breast-cancer-ml
jupyter notebook
```
